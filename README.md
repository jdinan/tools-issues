MPI Tools Working Group
=======================

The goal of this working group is define interfaces that can be used by software development tools (including, but not limited to, performance measurements tools, debuggers, and correctness checkers) to gain information about internals of the MPI library, interactions between an application and the MPI library, as well as the system environment an MPI application runs in. This is intended as an extension to the existing and widely used PMPI interface. These efforts will help in providing reliable and portable interfaces for MPI tools with new functionality currently not covered by the MPI standard.
